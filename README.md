<h3> Introduction</h3>
<h5>For the last stretch of my time as a student at the tech academy, I participated in their live project segment. The live projects are a 2 week sprint working with various languages, both front end and back end. Each day there was a short stand-up meeting with the live project instructors and the other students invovled with the project. We would discuss objectives and difficulties for the day, and was quite helpful and interesting to see in action. The first live project I partook in was building a C# Code-First MVC web application for a local theatre company. I was assigned stories in both front end using HTML and CSS/Bootstrap, and back end using C# and my knowledge of SQL Server.  The information I learned through the live projects was invaluable, and an experience I will profit from going forward in my programming career. Below I will list the various stories I had the privilage of working on, the reason for their creation, what each section does, and my thought process while working. <h5>
